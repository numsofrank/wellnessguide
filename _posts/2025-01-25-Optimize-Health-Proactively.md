# Optimize Health Proactively: Sha’s Functional Medicine Approach

*Explore the science-backed pillars of wellnes for Next Health, and transform your health through prevention, habit tracking, and cutting-edge diagnostics.*



---

## Introduction: From Surgery to Holistic Health

Dr. Daran Sha, a former top surgeon, once believed in fixing health issues only after they happened. But personal struggles with chronic issues led him to discover the limits of reactive Western medicine. Today, as the founder of Next Health—the world’s largest health optimization and longevity clinic—he champions a new model: **functional medicine**. This proactive approach aims to prevent disease before it starts by optimizing daily habits, tracking key biomarkers, and leveraging advanced diagnostics.

In this article, you’ll learn Dr. Sha’s seven pillars of health optimization:

1. **Nutrition** (fresh, whole foods & glucose control)  
2. **Movement** (fight sedentary behavior & strength training)  
3. **Sleep** (address apnea & align circadian rhythms)  
4. **Gut Health** (combat inflammation & leaky gut)  
5. **Heart Health** (advanced lipid markers)  
6. **Brain Health** (cognitive maintenance & Alzheimer’s prevention)  
7. **Cancer Prevention** (liquid biopsies & full-body MRIs)

## 1. Nutrition: The 20/80 Principle

Dr. Sha highlights that switching from ultra-processed to fresh, organic whole foods delivers **80%** of the nutritional benefits needed for optimal health. Key nutrition strategies include:

- **Blood glucose control:** Use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to see how foods affect you in real time.  
- **Adequate protein intake:** Aim for 1.2–1.5 grams per kg body weight daily to preserve muscle and metabolic health.  
- **Plenty of vegetables:** Fill half your plate with colorful veggies to boost fiber, micronutrients, and gut microbiome diversity.

> **Tip:** Start by replacing one processed snack per day with whole-food alternatives (e.g., fresh fruit, nuts). These incremental changes pack a powerful nutritional punch.

## 2. Movement: Combat Sedentary Behavior

Sitting for prolonged periods raises mortality risk linearly—every 10% increase in sitting time ups your risk by 10%. Dr. Sha recommends:

- **Exercise snacks:** Stand up or march in place for 2–3 minutes every 45 minutes.  
- **Social exercise:** Activities like group hikes or pickleball boost adherence and mental well-being.  
- **Strength training:** Especially after age 40, weightlifting maintains muscle mass, metabolic rate, and reduces frailty risk.

> **Pro Tip:** Set a timer on your phone or computer as an “exercise snack” reminder. Even 2 minutes counts.

## 3. Sleep: The Underestimated Pillar

Quality sleep underpins every aspect of health. Dr. Sha stresses:

- **Sleep apnea screening:** Undiagnosed apnea can disrupt metabolism and accelerate Alzheimer’s risk.  
- **Optimize environment:** Keep your bedroom dark, cool (~65°F/18°C), and quiet.  
- **Consistent routines:** Go to bed and wake at the same times to align your circadian rhythm.

> **Fact:** Treating sleep apnea can reduce cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk by over 30%.

## 4. Gut Health: Foundation of Wellness

Often overlooked and stigmatized, gut health is central to systemic inflammation. Key actions:

- **Monitor hs-CRP:** High-sensitivity C-reactive protein reveals systemic inflammation, often driven by gut issues.  
- **Diverse fiber sources:** Include prebiotic-rich foods—onions, garlic, artichokes—for a healthy microbiome.  
- **Address dysbiosis:** Probiotics or targeted antimicrobials can restore balance when necessary.

> **Note:** A healthy gut lining prevents “leaky gut,” reducing the risk of autoimmune and chronic diseases.

## 5. Heart Health: Advanced Lipid Testing

Traditional cholesterol panels miss early warning signs. Dr. Sha recommends advanced markers:

- **ApoB:** The number of atherogenic particles.  
- **Lp(a):** A genetically determined risk factor for heart disease.

By testing these, you can intervene decades before clinical events like heart attacks.

## 6. Brain Health: Preventing Cognitive Decline

Quality sleep, movement, and nutrition support brain function. Additionally:

- **Monitor insulin resistance:** High blood sugar fuels Alzheimer’s pathology.  
- **Mental fitness:** Incorporate novelty—learning new skills or languages—to boost neuroplasticity.

> **Research:** Individuals with untreated sleep apnea have a 30–40% higher risk of developing dementia.

## 7. Cancer Prevention: Early Detection & Detox

Dr. Sha emphasizes the power of early diagnostics:

- **Liquid biopsies:** Blood tests that detect tumor DNA fragments before symptoms appear.  
- **Full-body MRI scans:** Comprehensive imaging can reveal small lesions or tumors early.  
- **Toxin reduction:** Minimize exposure to endocrine disruptors—plastics, pesticides—to “cancer proof” your environment.

> **Insight:** Early detection through liquid biopsies can increase 5-year cancer survival rates by 20–30%.

## Tracking & Becoming Your Health CEO

Data empowers action. Dr. Sha advises regular monitoring of:

- **Vitamin D:** Aim for 50–80 ng/mL.  
- **HbA1c & CGM:** Keep HbA1c <5.7% and monitor daily glucose swings.  
- **Inflammatory markers:** hs-CRP <1.0 mg/L indicates low systemic inflammation.

Use apps and digital dashboards to visualize trends and intervene early.

## Conclusion: Embrace Proactive Health Optimization

Dr. Daran Sha’s journey from surgeon to functional medicine pioneer reveals a bold truth: waiting for disease is outdated. By embracing the seven pillars—nutrition, movement, sleep, gut, heart, brain, and cancer prevention—you can shift from reactive care to proactive health optimization.

Start small: replace one processed snack, stand up every hour, or schedule a sleep apnea test. Track your biomarkers and adjust habits. Over time, these incremental changes yield exponential gains in lifespan and health span.

**Become the CEO of your health**—because prevention truly is the best medicine.
